#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - Linear 

b) O(n^n) - Loop nested within loops will have an exponential effect in runtime. 

c) O(n) - Linear only recursion loop. 


## Exercise II

def brokenEggs(floor)

  if floor == f
    eggs gets += broken
  else floor < f
    eggs is not broken


runtime complexity is 0(1)
